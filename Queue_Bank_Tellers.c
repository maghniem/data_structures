/*This program implements a circular array with the following operations:
enqueue, dequeue, front, size, isEmpty, and isFull. 
The program checks when the queue is full in the enqueue operation
and when the queue is empty in the dequeue operation.*/

/*This program implements a queue to simulate a bank with 3 tellers and one line. The time between arrival of
customers is a random integer between 1 and 5. When a customer arrives, the customer gets in line. When any of
the three tellers is available, the first customer in line goes to that teller. The time to process that customerâ€™s
transaction is another random integer between 1 and 5. When the transaction is completed, the customer leaves.

The simulation is done for 100 customer and  the average time the customer waits in the queue is reported.*/
